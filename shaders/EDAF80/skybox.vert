// Remember how we enabled vertex attributes in assignmentÂ 2 and attached some
// data to each of them, here we retrieve that data. Attribute 0 pointed to the
// vertices inside the OpenGL buffer object, so if we say that our input
// variable `vertex` is at location 0, which corresponds to attribute 0 of our
// vertex array, vertex will be effectively filled with vertices from our
// buffer.
// Similarly, normal is set to location 1, which corresponds to attribute 1 of
// the vertex array, and therefore will be filled with normals taken out of our
// buffer.

// This is the custom output of this shader. If you want to retrieve this data
// from another shader further down the pipeline, you need to declare the exact
// same structure as in (for input), with matching name for the structure
// members and matching structure type. Have a look at
// shaders/EDAF80/diffuse.frag.
